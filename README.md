# RansomeRambo
'RasomeRambo.py' is the main file which can help you understand the whole thing.
'RasomeRambo_SP-BITE.py' is a programm where superPaste(one of my previous project) is injected with RansomeRambo(if you want to use this programm inside any project of yours , you need to plant it manually).

"crypt.py" is the example file provided by the DEV's of the cryptography library, going through that file can help you understand the basic principle.

1. A ransomeware which can encrypt all the files(all the extensions the user has selected) and decrypt them , all via a remote access

2. You can add as many extensions you want to encrypt.

3. Add the auth token , name and username of your repo in order to use it and know that who executed the program.

4. But first remember to add a key.(k="bImD4glbqcfVl7EyyTVJxqc6N_bdu6UR_yDte2tqerU=" -> I generated this one, you can generate key using the cryptography lib in python)
